Image Classification with TensorFlow
This project demonstrates how to build an image classification model using TensorFlow. The model is trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes. The images are split into 50,000 training samples and 10,000 test samples.
